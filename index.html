      <h1>Consulting with client</h1>
      <p>I have been working with a photographer who wanted a new website.
        She was using a platform which she was not happy with and I
        recommended to use Wordpress. She thought it wa a good idea because of
        the benefits and the easy use of Wordpress. Also it worked out cheaper for her.
        Check out the website I made for her <a href="http://www.ralucababosphotography.com" target="_blank">here.</a>

      </p>

<div class="post">
 <div id="two">
   <h1>Transferring existing domain</h1>
   <p>To transfer her existing domain I had to get autherisation code from her the previous platform
   she was using for her old website and request a swap from wordress. I took about one week
 for her domain do be activ on her new wordress website.</p>


 </div>

 <div id="three">
   <h1>Wordpress</h1>
   <img src="kepek/dashboard.jpg" alt="dashboard">
   <p>It took a little bit of time to get familiar with the way wordpress admin works.
   Watching tutorials on youtube has helped me a lot in figuring out things that I did not know
 by myself. Also the business plan allowed me to chat with wordpress developers, and I
just had to tell them what I was stuck with and they told me what to do exacly.
For example I founf out that I can not include full width images to all pages, only to the ones
with the theme of 'homepage'.</p>

 </div>

</div>
<div class="post">
 <div id="four">
   <h1>Choosing the right theme</h1>
   <img src="kepek/theme.jpg" alt="theme">
   <p>
   Since she is a photographer, I had to consider very carefully what theme to choose for her website.
   She has sent me some websites that insipre her, and it helped me to look for something
   similar. Then I showed her the ones I thought would suit her needs the most and let her
     pick the one she liked best. It is a theme that has a portfolio page option which allows
     her to showcase clearly and beautifully her photoshoots. </p>

   <h1>Wesbos online shortcourse completion</h1>
   <img src="kepek/wesbos.jpg" alt="wesbos">
   <p>I have completed the Wesbos  CSS grid online shortcourse to learn how to use
     CSS grid. It consists of 25 modules each 5-30 minutes long. Each module has the completed
     version as well as the uncompleted. He talked through each module and meanwhile
     I completed them. I have learnet many new things about CSS and cases where it might more
   appropriate to use flex box instead. One of the most important things I have learned
 is to use grid template column attribute. </p>

   <h1>Completing exercises from HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett</h1>
   <p>I have purchased this book to give my learning a structure, as I am self thought, it is
   important that I learn the fundamentals first, instead trying to learn something
 complicated. This book is really helpful because it builds up on each chapter therefore
everything makes sense and helps me to learn quicker in less time. I also love how this book
explains everything with images as well.</p>
<img src="kepek/table.jpg" alt="table">
<p>This is an example of a table I have learned to do from the book. What I would like to learn
more about and practice is to make a form from scratch. </p>

   <h1>Project-Customize your bear- First mock up for phone</h1>
   <img src="kepek/teddyphone.jpg" alt="teddyphone">
   <p>As part of my internship I started developing a fur bear customisation application. This
   is the first mock up version for phone. I have done this in just a few hours to be able
 to show how it would work. The next step was to make a desktop version and expand the
choices.  </p>

 </div>

</div>
<div class="post">
 <div id="eight">
   <h1>Project-Customize your bear-for desktop</h1>
   <img src="kepek/desktopvo1.jpg" alt="">
   <p>This is the first desktop version of the user interfaces of the application.
     This needed to be extended and more options to be added.</p>

<div class="post">
 <div id="ten">
   <h1>Integrating it to the existing website</h1>
   <p>The enxt question was how to integrate this to the existing website. I was not sure
   what are the restrictions of her existing theme, but suggested to add custome code to a
 new blank page on her website. I consulted with her web developer and found out that
they are going to make her a new online shop with a different platform called Magento where
this is possible with a plug in so it was not necessary for me the write the code for the application,
however it could still be a project. </p>
